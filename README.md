A simple one-click `.command` script for macOS that uses Docker to separate vocals and instrumentals from any song using a YouTube URL — no need for premium services like Moises or LALALA.

## ✨ What It Does

This script:

1. Pulls the `audio-separator` Docker image.
2. Downloads audio from a YouTube link you provide.
3. Runs the Docker container with the downloaded file as input.
4. Outputs two files:
   - `vocals.wav`
   - `instrumental.wav`

All in just a few steps on your Mac.

### 🧰 Installing Homebrew (if you don’t have it)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that lets you install tools like `yt-dlp` easily.

### 💡 Why?

Services like Moises and LALALA have daily limits or require subscriptions. This tool:
- Is free, offline, and utilizes existing open-source software
- Works great for mashups, remixes, karaoke, and production
Perfect if you don’t have access to stem separation in tools like Logic Pro.
