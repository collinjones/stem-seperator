A simple one-click `.command` script for macOS that uses Docker to separate vocals and instrumentals from any song using a YouTube URL ‚Äî no need for premium services like Moises or LALALA.

## ‚ú® What It Does

This script:

1. Pulls the `audio-separator` Docker image.
2. Downloads audio from a YouTube link you provide.
3. Runs the Docker container with the downloaded file as input.
4. Outputs two files (Vocals and instrumental)

All in just a few steps on your Mac.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- macOS
- [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## How to use?

You will have to copy and paste into Terminal the following commands to remove Gatekeeper's quarantine from my program before running. 

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine yt-dlp`
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine seperate .command`

1. Double-click on `separate.command` and it will prompt you for a choice between Local File and YouTube URL
2. Enter the URL or choose a file
3. Wait! The prompt may look frozen - it's just getting everything ready 


## üí° Why?

Services like Moises and LALALA have daily limits or require subscriptions. This tool:
- Is free, offline, and utilizes existing open-source software
- Works great for mashups, remixes, karaoke, and production
  
Perfect if you don‚Äôt have access to stem separation in tools like Logic Pro.
